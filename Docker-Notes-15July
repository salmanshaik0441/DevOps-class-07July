Install Docker:


Docker Host:

$ sudo su -

$ yum install docker -y


Start docker service

$ systemctl start docker

This command is used to query images present on docker host

$ docker images


Images are always maintained in docker hub, you need to pull from docker hub



How do we give name of the image

 imagename:tagname

$ docker pull imagename

$ docker pull ubuntu

docker will pull image form docker hub of version/tag = latest

$ $ docker pull imagename:tagname

$ $ docker pull ubuntu:18.04

$ docker pull tomcat:7

docker will pull image form docker hub of version/tag = 18.04


How do we create a container

> containers are always created by execution of  "docker run image" command

An Image can run in 2 modes

1. forground mode (-it)

When an image is run to create a container in foreground mode, user will be logged on the container

$  docker run -it ubuntu

comeout of container

ctl + pq  ==> user will be out of container and container will be running

exit ==> user will be out of container and container will be exited

query the containers on host with any status:

$ docker ps -a

query container that are up & running only

$ docker ps

2. detached mode (-d)

When an image is run to create a container in detached mode,

Continer will be created and will be running

 user will not be logged on the container

  $ docker run -d --name n1 nginx


How to access the container:

Access OS type container within the docker host


if you want to be on the contaienr to create a file, to make chnages , to modify data

that process is called as attaching to the container

for this process, container has to be up & running


if you have a container which is exited, how can we start it

$ docker start containerid/containername

Now attach to the container:

$ docker attach containerid/containername

Comeout of container

Ctl +pq

Stop a running container

$ docker stop containerid/containername


***************

how to see all the details of a container:

$ docker inspect containername


How to delete containers:

docker rm -f 2d78ec816a65 394b07f77d7b
